          We create large-scale Montessori-style learning boards that are accessible to children 
          with various abilities. These boards help develop fine motor skills, problem-solving, 
          and cognitive development through hands-on learning.

        <h1 className="who-title">What Makes It Special</h1>
        <p className="who-text">
          Our Montessori boards are designed to be accessible to children with different physical 
          and cognitive abilities. We use larger components, adaptive handles, and custom 
          mechanisms that make learning activities accessible to all children.

        <h1 className="who-title">Learning Benefits</h1>
        <p className="who-text">
          These boards help children develop essential skills like hand-eye coordination, 
          spatial awareness, and logical thinking. The activities are designed to be engaging 
          and educational while being accessible to children with various needs.

        <h1 className="who-title">Customization</h1>
        <p className="who-text">
          Each Montessori board is customized based on the child's specific abilities and 
          learning goals. We work with families and educators to create boards that address 
          individual needs while providing engaging learning experiences.
