      question: "Do you work with healthcare professionals?",

    {
      question: "Can you help children with any type of disability?",

      question: "Do you provide ongoing support after delivery?",
      answer: "Yes, we provide follow-up support to ensure the equipment continues to meet the child's needs as they grow and develop. We offer maintenance, adjustments, and modifications as needed. We also stay in touch with families to learn about the impact of our work."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I spread the word about A4A?",
      answer: "You can help by sharing our social media posts, telling families who might benefit from our services, connecting us with healthcare providers, or inviting us to speak at community events. Word-of-mouth referrals are one of our most valuable ways of reaching families in need."
