            <h2>Making Dreams Accessible</h2>
            <p>
            Accessible 4 All is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and student-led organization dedicated to creating innovative engineering 
            solutions that support children with disabilities. We believe every child deserves the opportunity to play, learn, and grow in an 
            inclusive environmentâ€”at no cost to their families. Providing our services completely free is a core part of our mission, ensuring 
            that accessibility is never limited by financial barriers. Through our projects, we bridge the gap between engineering education and 
            real-world impact, making a lasting difference in the lives of families and communities.
