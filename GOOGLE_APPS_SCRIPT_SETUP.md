# Google Apps Script Setup for Student Interest Form

This guide will help you connect your Student Interest Form to the Google Sheet at: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_1L6E04ggF5wjpXBok6cTs3tjzBLw1zgugFG89bB0w/edit?gid=0#gid=0`

## Step 1: Set Up Google Apps Script

1. **Go to Google Apps Script**
   - Visit: https://script.google.com/
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Give it a name like "A4A Student Interest Form Handler"

3. **Copy the Script Code**
   - Delete the default `Code.gs` content
   - Copy the entire content from `student-interest-form-script.js` in your project
   - Paste it into the Google Apps Script editor

## Step 2: Deploy the Script

1. **Save the Project**
   - Click the save icon or press Ctrl+S
   - Give your project a name if prompted

2. **Deploy as Web App**
   - Click "Deploy" â†’ "New deployment"
   - Choose "Web app" as the type
   - Set the following options:
     - **Execute as**: "Me" (your Google account)
     - **Who has access**: "Anyone" (for now, you can restrict this later)
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Authorize the Script**
   - Google will ask for permissions
   - Click "Continue" and authorize the script to:
     - Read/write to your Google Sheets
     - Send emails on your behalf

4. **Get the Script URL**
   - After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
     `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz.../exec`
   - Copy this URL - you'll need it for the next step

## Step 3: Update Your React Component

1. **Open the Interest Form Component**
   - Navigate to `src/components/Students/InterestForm.js`

2. **Replace the Script URL**
   - Find the line: `// const scriptUrl = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec';`
   - Replace `YOUR_SCRIPT_ID` with the actual script ID from your deployment URL
   - Uncomment the fetch code block

3. **The updated code should look like this:**
   ```javascript
   const scriptUrl = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbz.../exec';
   
   const response = await fetch(scriptUrl, {
     method: 'POST',
     mode: 'no-cors',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
     },
     body: submissionData.toString()
   });
   ```

## Step 4: Set Up the Google Sheet

1. **Open Your Google Sheet**
   - Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_1L6E04ggF5wjpXBok6cTs3tjzBLw1zgugFG89bB0w/edit?gid=0#gid=0

2. **Set Up Headers (Optional)**
   - If the sheet is empty, you can run the setup function
   - In Google Apps Script, go to the "Functions" dropdown
   - Select `setupStudentInterestSpreadsheet`
   - Click the "Run" button
   - This will create the proper headers for your form data

3. **Verify Permissions**
   - Make sure your Google account has edit access to the sheet
   - The script will need to write to this sheet

## Step 5: Test the Connection

1. **Test Individual Components First**
   - In Google Apps Script, go to the "Functions" dropdown
   - First, run `testSpreadsheetOnly` to test spreadsheet access
   - Then, run `testEmailOnly` to test email functionality
   - Check the execution logs for each test

2. **Test the Full Form**
   - Select `testStudentInterestForm` from the Functions dropdown
   - Click "Run"
   - Check the execution log to see if it works

2. **Test the Form**
   - Fill out your Student Interest Form on your website
   - Submit the form
   - Check your Google Sheet to see if the data appears
   - Check your email for confirmation messages

## Step 6: Security Considerations

1. **Restrict Access (Optional)**
   - In your Google Apps Script deployment settings
   - Change "Who has access" to "Anyone with Google account" for better security

2. **Add CAPTCHA (Recommended)**
   - Consider adding reCAPTCHA to prevent spam submissions
   - This can be done by modifying the form to include reCAPTCHA

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Script not found" error**
   - Make sure you copied the correct script ID from the deployment URL
   - Verify the script is deployed and accessible

2. **"Permission denied" error**
   - Make sure you authorized the script properly
   - Check that your Google account has access to the sheet

3. **Data not appearing in sheet**
   - Check the execution logs in Google Apps Script
   - Verify the spreadsheet ID is correct
   - Make sure the sheet is not protected

4. **Emails not sending**
   - Check if your Google account has email sending permissions
   - Verify the email addresses are correct

### Debugging:

1. **Check Execution Logs**
   - In Google Apps Script, click "Executions" in the left sidebar
   - View the logs for any error messages

2. **Test Individual Functions**
   - Use the test functions provided in the script
   - Run them one by one to isolate issues

Your project should now have:
- `student-interest-form-script.js` - The Google Apps Script code
